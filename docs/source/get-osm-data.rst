Get OSM Data
============

osm2gmns requires OpenStreetMap data as input. 
Four options are provided to download OSM data. 
Users can choose the one that best suits their needs.

.. note::

    - The file formats of map data supported in osm2gmns include ``.osm``, ``.xml``, and ``.pbf``.


1) OpenStreetMap Homepage (Suitable for Smaller Areas)

Go to the OpenStreetMap `homepage`_.
Navigate to your area of interest.
Click the "Export" button at the top. You can adjust the bounding box manually if needed.
Click the blue "Export" button in the left panel to download the data.

Note that if the target area is too large, you may get an error message: "You requested too many nodes
(limit is 50000). Either request a smaller area, or use planet.osm". In this case, you can always click
``Overpass API`` to download the network you need via a mirror site.

2) Geofabrik (Recommended for Administrative Regions)

Visit the `Geofabrik`_ download website.
Navigate through the continental and regional links to find your area.
Download the data extract for your specific administrative region.

Generally, there are multiple types of file format for users to choose when downloading map data.

3) BBBike (Custom Polygonal Areas)

Go to the `BBBike`_ download website.
Use the map interface to draw a custom polygon around your exact area of interest.
Enter your email address and select the desired format.
Submit the request; you will receive an email with a download link when the extract is ready.

4) Overpass API (Programmatic Download by Relation ID)

osm2gmns also enables users to download OSM data within the region of interest using a built-in function.
A region can be a state, city, or even university. On OpenStreetMap `homepage`_, search the region name to get
its unique relation id. The following example shows how to download Tempe city OSM data using function
``downloadOSMData``.

osm2gmns includes a function to download data directly via the Overpass API, 
using an OSM Relation ID.

Go to the OpenStreetMap `homepage`_.
Search for the administrative region or feature.
Click on the correct search result.
The URL in your browser will contain the relation ID. The number is the ID. You can also often find it listed in the object's details/tags on the left panel.
