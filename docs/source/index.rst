osm2gmns is a high-performance Python package designed to convert `OpenStreetMap`_ (OSM) 
data into standardized transportation networks. Leveraging a C++ core wrapped in an 
intuitive Python interface, osm2gmns offers both computational speed and ease of use. 
**It empowers researchers and practitioners to generate detailed, multi-modal networks (driving, cycling, walking, railway, aeroway) for any region worldwide with minimal coding effort**.

The package outputs networks primarily in the `GMNS`_ (General Modeling Network Specification) 
format, promoting interoperability and simplifying data exchange within the transportation 
modeling community.

    >>> import osm2gmns as og
    >>> net = og.getNetFromFile('map.osm')
    >>> og.outputNetToCSV(net)


.. note::
   **Welcome to the osm2gmns v1.x Documentation!**

   This v1.x version introduces significant architectural changes, performance improvements, and 
   new features compared to `v0.x`_, and is **not fully backward compatible**.

   - We encourage users to adopt v1.x for the latest capabilities and ongoing development.
   - v0.x will only receive critical bug fixes moving forward.
   - Functionality like Multi-Resolution Modeling (MRM), currently available only in v0.x, is planned for future v1.x releases.


Key Features
====================================

1. Comprehensive Network Modeling

- Worldwide Network: Generate networks from OpenStreetMap for any region globally
- Multi-Modal Support: Generate networks for vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, railways, and aeroways
- GMNS Compatibility: Standardized output format for interoperability with other tools

2. Advanced Functionality

- Intersection Consolidation: Simplifies complex junctions for various modeling needs
- Movement Generation: Creates turning movements at intersections
- Directed Network Generation: Automatic creation of directional links for bidirectional roadways
